natur languag process ( nlp ) refer to the branch of comput science—and more specif , the branch of artifici intellig or ai—concern with give comput the abil to understand text and spoken word in much the same way human be can . nlp combin comput linguistics—rule-bas model of human language—with statist , machin learn , and deep learn model . togeth , these technolog enabl comput to process human languag in the form of text or voic data and to ‘ understand ’ it full mean , complet with the speaker or writer ’ s intent and sentiment . nlp drive comput program that translat text from one languag to anoth , respond to spoken command , and summar larg volum of text rapidly—even in real time . there ’ s a good chanc you ’ ve interact with nlp in the form of voice-oper gp system , digit assist , speech-to-text dictat softwar , custom servic chatbot , and other consum conveni . but nlp also play a grow role in enterpris solut that help streamlin busi oper , increas employe product , and simplifi mission-crit busi process . begin your journey to ai learn how to scale ai explor the ai academi nlp task human languag is fill with ambigu that make it incred difficult to write softwar that accur determin the intend mean of text or voic data . homonym , homophon , sarcasm , idiom , metaphor , grammar and usag except , variat in sentenc structure—thes just a few of the irregular of human languag that take human year to learn , but that programm must teach natur language-driven applic to recogn and understand accur from the start , if those applic are go to be use . sever nlp task break down human text and voic data in way that help the comput make sens of what it 's ingest . some of these task includ the follow : speech recognit , also call speech-to-text , is the task of reliabl convert voic data into text data . speech recognit is requir for ani applic that follow voic command or answer spoken question . what make speech recognit especi challeng is the way peopl talk—quickli , slur word togeth , with vari emphasi and inton , in differ accent , and often use incorrect grammar . part of speech tag , also call grammat tag , is the process of determin the part of speech of a particular word or piec of text base on it use and context . part of speech identifi ‘ make ’ as a verb in ‘ i can make a paper plane , ’ and as a noun in ‘ what make of car do you own ? ’ word sens disambigu is the select of the mean of a word with multipl mean through a process of semant analysi that determin the word that make the most sens in the given context . for exampl , word sens disambigu help distinguish the mean of the verb 'make ' in ‘ make the grade ’ ( achiev ) vs. ‘ make a bet ’ ( place ) . name entiti recognit , or nem , identifi word or phrase as use entiti . nem identifi ‘ kentucki ’ as a locat or ‘ fred ’ as a man 's name . co-refer resolut is the task of identifi if and when two word refer to the same entiti . the most common exampl is determin the person or object to which a certain pronoun refer ( e.g. , ‘ she ’ = ‘ mari ’ ) , but it can also involv identifi a metaphor or an idiom in the text ( e.g. , an instanc in which 'bear ' is n't an anim but a larg hairi person ) . sentiment analysi attempt to extract subject qualities—attitud , emot , sarcasm , confus , suspicion—from text . natur languag gener is sometim describ as the opposit of speech recognit or speech-to-text ; it 's the task of put structur inform into human languag . see the blog post “ nlp vs. nlu vs. nlg : the differ between three natur languag process concept ” for a deeper look into how these concept relat . now avail : watsonx.ai the all new enterpris studio that bring togeth tradit machin learn along with new gener ai capabl power by foundat model tri watsonx.ai nlp tool and approach python and the natur languag toolkit ( nltk ) the python program languag provid a wide rang of tool and librari for attack specif nlp task . mani of these are found in the natur languag toolkit , or nltk , an open sourc collect of librari , program , and educ resourc for build nlp program . the nltk includ librari for mani of the nlp task list abov , plu librari for subtask , such as sentenc pars , word segment , stem and lemmat ( method of trim word down to their root ) , and token ( for break phrase , sentenc , paragraph and passag into token that help the comput better understand the text ) . it also includ librari for implement capabl such as semant reason , the abil to reach logic conclus base on fact extract from text . statist nlp , machin learn , and deep learn the earliest nlp applic were hand-cod , rules-bas system that could perform certain nlp task , but could n't easili scale to accommod a seemingli endless stream of except or the increas volum of text and voic data . enter statist nlp , which combin comput algorithm with machin learn and deep learn model to automat extract , classifi , and label element of text and voic data and then assign a statist likelihood to each possibl mean of those element . today , deep learn model and learn techniqu base on convolut neural network ( cnn ) and recurr neural network ( rnn ) enabl nlp system that 'learn ' as they work and extract ever more accur mean from huge volum of raw , unstructur , and unlabel text and voic data set . for a deeper dive into the nuanc between these technolog and their learn approach , see “ ai vs. machin learn vs. deep learn vs. neural network : what ’ s the differ ? ” nlp use case natur languag process is the drive forc behind machin intellig in mani modern real-world applic . here are a few exampl : spam detect : you may not think of spam detect as an nlp solut , but the best spam detect technolog use nlp 's text classif capabl to scan email for languag that often indic spam or phish . these indic can includ overus of financi term , characterist bad grammar , threaten languag , inappropri urgenc , misspel compani name , and more . spam detect is one of a hand of nlp problem that expert consid 'mostli solv ' ( although you may argu that thi doesn ’ t match your email experi ) . machin translat : googl translat is an exampl of wide avail nlp technolog at work . truli use machin translat involv more than replac word in one languag with word of anoth . effect translat ha to captur accur the mean and tone of the input languag and translat it to text with the same mean and desir impact in the output languag . machin translat tool are make good progress in term of accuraci . a great way to test ani machin translat tool is to translat text to one languag and then back to the origin . an oft-cit classic exampl : not long ago , translat “ the spirit is will but the flesh is weak ” from english to russian and back yield “ the vodka is good but the meat is rotten. ” today , the result is “ the spirit desir , but the flesh is weak , ” which isn ’ t perfect , but inspir much more confid in the english-to-russian translat . virtual agent and chatbot : virtual agent such as appl 's siri and amazon 's alexa use speech recognit to recogn pattern in voic command and natur languag gener to respond with appropri action or help comment . chatbot perform the same magic in respons to type text entri . the best of these also learn to recogn contextu clue about human request and use them to provid even better respons or option over time . the next enhanc for these applic is question answer , the abil to respond to our questions—anticip or not—with relev and help answer in their own word . social media sentiment analysi : nlp ha becom an essenti busi tool for uncov hidden data insight from social media channel . sentiment analysi can analyz languag use in social media post , respons , review , and more to extract attitud and emot in respons to product , promot , and events–inform compani can use in product design , advertis campaign , and more . text summar : text summar use nlp techniqu to digest huge volum of digit text and creat summari and synops for index , research databas , or busi reader who do n't have time to read full text . the best text summar applic use semant reason and natur languag gener ( nlg ) to add use context and conclus to summari . relat solut watson natur languag process solut acceler the busi valu of artifici intellig with a power and flexibl portfolio of librari , servic and applic . explor natur languag process watson natur languag process librari for emb infus power natur languag ai into commerci applic with a container librari design to empow ibm partner with greater flexibl . explor watson natur languag process librari for emb resourc how-to free , hands-on learn for gener ai technolog learn the fundament concept for ai and gener ai , includ prompt engin , larg languag model and the best open sourc project . natur languag process with watson learn about differ nlp use case in thi nlp explain . enhanc your applic with ibm embedd ai visit the ibm develop 's websit to access blog , articl , newslett and more . becom an ibm partner and infus ibm watson embedd ai in your commerci solut today . bm watson nlp librari for emb into your solut . acceler and scale innov with ibm embedd ai ibm digit self-serv co-creat experi ( dsce ) help data scientist , applic develop and ml-op engin discov and tri ibm 's embedd ai portfolio across ibm watson librari , ibm watson api and ibm ai applic . watson understand the languag of your busi watch ibm data & ai gm , rob thoma as he host nlp expert and client , showcas how nlp technolog are optim busi across industri . advanc ai ethic beyond complianc ethic consider for ai have never been more critic than they are today . put more knowledg at the fingertip of non-english speaker ibm ha launch a new open-sourc toolkit , primeqa , to spur progress in multilingu question-answ system to make it easier for anyon to quickli find inform on the web . take the next step train , valid , tune and deploy gener ai , foundat model and machin learn capabl with ibm watsonx.ai™ , a next gener enterpris studio for ai builder . build ai applic in a fraction of the time with a fraction of the data . explor watsonx.ai request a demo
